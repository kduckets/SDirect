          <p class="lead">We are a group of musicians who have a lifelong addiction to music.
            We play in bars and clubs around California and understand the importance of a
            high quality product with fantastic tone. We are always on the hunt for the best
            gear available and accept no shortcuts when it comes to quality.</p>

            <p class="lead">After many years of playing music,
              we decided that the traditional way to buy strings and
              picks sucked. We were going to chain stores and having to
              wait in line or clumsily batch ordering online. Often times
              we were just looking for a pick and forgetting to change our strings all together.
              As you know, this leads to poor tone, grime and broken strings.</p>

<p class="lead">ReString Club solves these issues by offering a boutique, high end line of strings and pics
delivered to you on a monthly basis. We will send you a new kit right when you need to swap out.
Itâ€™s not only super convenient but it also helps keep your playing on schedule and your tone sharp.
We are confident ours are the finest U.S.A. made strings available and we are excited to share them with you.</p>

<p class="lead">Welcome to the club!</p>
